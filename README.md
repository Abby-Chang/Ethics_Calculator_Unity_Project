# Ethics_Calculator_Unity_Project
This is the Unity Project for the Ethics Calculator
We have 6 groups of 5 different ethical schools
Kantian, Rawlsian, Neoliberal Team 1, Neoliberal Team 2, Utilitarian, Virtue Ethics
Each group will contribute choices a user can pick in a CBC Questionare to determine their ethical aligment.
